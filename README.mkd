EOS BUILD PROCESS
================

This script is intended to be used by all the nodes participating in the
boot sequence.

Very highlevel description of the stepts to be performed:

1. Checkout and verify code
2. Apply patches
3. Build
4. Spit out env file so we can test "sandboxed"

Hope this will be helpfull.
